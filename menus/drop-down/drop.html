        <h1>Example of a sliding menu</h1>
        <p>I have a real-world project that I'm about to start on and the spec calls for a drop-down mobile menu.  I figure that the point is to animate the transition more than the direction that it comes from.  So, I decided to do this assignment as a warmup for the contract.</p>
        <p>For this single component I decided to go with plain <abbr>CSS</abbr>.  I've used variables for all colors but I've just hand-written everything else. I decided to go this direction because I'll be saving this into my own private components library and I felt like it would be easier to convert the <abbr>CSS</abbr> into <abbr>SCSS</abbr> rather than the other way around, depending on the way the projects I might use this in are built.</p>
        <p>One final design choice I made for this component was to have it display as a block so that it would push existing page content down instead of go over the top of it.  That way, the menu could stay open and leave the content visible to the user if the user chose not to navigate away from the page.  I understand some of my decisions with this project aren't in line with the assignment instructions.  I hope this is not a problem.</p>
