    <h1>Web API's</h1>
    <p>Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) are constructs made available in programming languages to allow developers to create complex functionality more easily.<br>
        For example, if you need to program some 3D graphics, it is a lot easier to do it using an API written in a higher-level language such as JavaScript or Python, rather than try to directly write low-level code (say C or C++) that directly controls the computer's GPU or other graphics functions.</p>
    <h2>Client-Side JS API's</h2>
    <p><h3>There are two general categories:</h3>
        <ul><li><strong>Browser APIs</strong> are built into your web browser and are able to expose data from the browser and surrounding computer environment and do useful complex things with it. For example, the Web Audio API provides JavaScript constructs for manipulating audio in the browser — taking an audio track, altering its volume, applying effects to it, etc. In the background, the browser is actually using some complex lower-level code (e.g., C++ or Rust) to do the actual audio processing.</li>
        <li><strong>Third-party APIs</strong> are not built into the browser by default, and you generally have to retrieve their code and information from somewhere on the Web. For example, the Google Maps API allows you to do things like display an interactive map to your office on your website. It provides a special set of constructs you can use to query the Google Maps service and return specific information.</li>
    </ul>
    </p>
    <p><h3>Common browser APIs:</h3>
        <ul><li><strong>APIs for manipulating documents loaded into the browser.</strong> The most obvious example is the DOM (Document Object Model) API, which allows you to manipulate HTML and CSS — creating, removing and changing HTML, dynamically applying new styles to your page, etc. Every time you see a popup window appear on a page or some new content displayed, for example, that's the DOM in action.</li>
        <li><strong>APIs that fetch data from the server to update small sections of a webpage on their own.</strong>This seemingly small detail has had a huge impact on the performance and behavior of sites — if you just need to update a stock listing or list of available new stories, doing it instantly without having to reload the whole entire page from the server can make the site or app feel much more responsive and "snappy". The main API used for this is the Fetch API, although older code might still use the XMLHttpRequest API. You may also come across the term AJAX, which describes this technique.</li>
        <li><strong>APIs for drawing and manipulating graphics.</strong>The most popular ones are Canvas and WebGL, which allow you to programmatically update the pixel data contained in an HTML canvas element to create 2D and 3D scenes. For example, you might draw shapes such as rectangles or circles, import an image onto the canvas, and apply a filter to it such as sepia or grayscale using the Canvas API, or create a complex 3D scene with lighting and textures using WebGL. Such APIs are often combined with APIs for creating animation loops (such as window.requestAnimationFrame()) and others to make constantly updating scenes like cartoons and games.</li>
        <li><strong>Audio and Video APIs like HTMLMediaElement, the Web Audio API, and WebRTC.</strong>These allow you to do really interesting things with multimedia such as creating custom UI controls for playing audio and video, displaying text tracks like captions and subtitles along with your videos, grabbing video from your web camera to be manipulated via a canvas (see above) or displayed on someone else's computer in a web conference, or adding effects to audio tracks</li>
        <li><strong>Device APIs</strong>These enable you to interact with device hardware: for example, accessing the device GPS to find the user's position using the Geolocation API.</li>
        <li><strong>Client-side storage APIs</strong>These enable you to store data on the client-side, so you can create an app that will save its state between page loads, and perhaps even work when the device is offline. There are several options available, e.g., simple name/value storage with the Web Storage API, and more complex database storage with the IndexedDB API.</li>
    </ul>
    </p>
    <p><h3>Common Third-party APIs</h3>
        <ul><li>Map APIs, like Mapquest and the Google Maps API, which allow you to do all sorts of things with maps on your web pages.</li>
        <li>The Facebook suite of APIs, which enables you to use various parts of the Facebook ecosystem to benefit your app, such as by providing app login using Facebook login, accepting in-app payments, rolling out targeted ad campaigns, etc.</li>
        <li>The Telegram APIs, which allows you to embed content from Telegram channels on your website, in addition to providing support for bots.</li>
        <li>The YouTube API, which allows you to embed YouTube videos on your site, search YouTube, build playlists, and more.</li>
        <li>The Pinterest API, which provides tools to manage Pinterest boards and pins to include them in your website.</li>
        <li>The Twilio API, which provides a framework for building voice and video call functionality into your app, sending SMS/MMS from your apps, and more.</li>
        <li>The Disqus API, which provides a commenting platform that can be integrated into your site.</li>   
        <li>The Mastodon API, which enables you to manipulate features of the Mastodon social network programmatically.</li>
        <li>The IFTTT API, which enables integrating multiple APIs through one platform.</li>
    </ul>
