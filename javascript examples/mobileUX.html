    <h1>Basic Usability Principles</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>Learnability: How easily first-time users complete basic tasks.</li>
        <li>Efficiency: How quickly users perform basic tasks once they’ve learned the design.</li>
        <li>Memorability: The ability of users to remember how to use the system.</li>
        <li>Errors: The amount and severity of errors users make and how easily they can correct them.</li>
        <li>Satisfaction: How pleasant the experience of using the design was.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>1. Content Prioritization</h2>
    <p>keep interface elements to a minimum.<br>
        Simple designs are what keep the user engaged and at ease with products.<br>
        Display only essential content and functionalities the user needs.<br>
        The limited space available on a small screen makes every additional element you add overwhelming to your users.<br>
        Secondary content should be available through a menu.<br>
        Menu lists, either short or long, should have progressive disclosure and simple terminology so as not to confuse your users.<br>
        To further reduce clutter, use icons instead of text wherever possible.
     </p>
     <h2>2. Make Navigation Intuitive</h2>
     <p>Users should intuitively be able to navigate through your app via clear pathways and be able to complete all primary tasks without requiring any explanations.<br>
        Users lack the patience to try to work through complex steps to get what they want.<br>
        When navigating through your app, the user should always know where they are without wondering how they got there, or what they are to do next.     
    </p>
    <h2>3. Touchscreen Target Sizes</h2>
    <p>Apple’s iPhone Human Interface Guidelines suggest a minimum target size of 44 pixels wide x 44 pixels tall.<br>
        In the Windows Phone UI Design and Interaction Guide, Microsoft suggests a touch target size of 9mm/34px with a minimum touch target size of 7mm/26px.<br>
        Not only is the size of the target important, but so is the spacing between targets.
    </p>
    <h2>4. Provide User Control</h2>
    <p>Allow users to make decisions to personalize their journeys.<br>
        Changing settings, controlling notifications and cancelling actions provides the user with a sense of control over the system.<br>
        Integrate status and other types of feedback into your interface without disrupting the user’s workflow.<br>
        If an app requires signup, let them demo it first or continue as a guest to sample it before making the decision to commit.
    </p>
    <h2>5. Legible Text Content</h2>
    <p>If users can’t read your content, there’s no point in offering content in the first place.<br>
        Generally, anything smaller than 16 pixels (or 11 points) becomes challenging to read for any screen.<br>
        Adversely, an unnecessarily large font size results in awkward breaks and hyphenation that take longer to read.<br>
        A good rule of thumb is to use 30–40 characters per line for mobile.<br>
        Adding space between text aids the user in reading and creates a feeling that there isn’t so much information to take in.
    </p>
    <h2>6. Make Interface Elements Clearly Visible</h2>
    <p>It’s important to have sufficient contrast between content and background in your designs so it’s legible, in any setting, even outside in the sunlight.<br>
        The most important part in choosing your text and background is to test it out with users.
    </p>
    <h2>7. Hand Position Controls</h2>
    <p>49% of people rely on one thumb.<br>
        Common features should be placed in easily accessible regions, while actions such as delete buttons should be placed in areas harder to reach to avoid errors.<br>
        Keeping in mind right- and left-handedness is also a design feature to consider.
    </p>
    <h2>8. Minimize Data Input</h2>
    <p>Typing on small devices can be annoying and there really isn’t a direct solution to it.<br>
        Work around the problem by minimizing the need to enter data in your designs.<br>
        Shorten forms, remove unnecessary fields and use ‘remember me’ options for future use.<br>
        Provide autocomplete, recent search history and location detection to reduce data entry requirements and accelerate the experience.<br>
        Display keyboard variations depending on the required data like the numeric keypad for phone numbers, for example.
    </p>
    <h2>9. Create A Seamless Experience</h2>
    <p>Seamless experiences are invisible.<br>
        The user doesn’t realize it, but the flow is a natural process and the user feels ‘right’ using it.<br>
        Functional, flexible, and responsive mobile designs are what users today expect to encounter.<br>
        Focus on key user goals by reducing friction, minimizing steps and page loads to decrease interaction time.<br>
        Make content accessible even without an online connection and provide alternative paths to avoid dead-ends.<br>
        Make use of the mobile phone’s features, like the camera to scan barcodes, GPS for identifying locations and touch ID in place of passcodes to simplify journeys.
    </p>
    <h2>10. Test Your Design</h2>
    <p>Test early. Test often.<br>
        The key to any successful product is to continuously test and optimize.<br>
        Test different features, layouts and variations of your designs to see what works best.<br>
        Build your products with a user-centered approach by testing with real users.
